	abstract = {The problem of efficient, interactive foreground/background segmentation in still images is of great practical importance in image editing. Classical image segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or edge (contrast) information, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects. First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation. Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a robust algorithm for "border matting" has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels. We show that for moderately difficult examples the proposed method outperforms competitive tools.},

Given a small number of pixels with user-defined (or predefined) labels, one can analytically and quickly determine the probability that a random walker starting at each unlabeled pixel will first reach one of the prelabeled pixels. By assigning each pixel to the label for which the greatest probability is calculated, a high-quality image segmentation may be obtained. Theoretical properties of this algorithm are developed along with the corresponding connections to discrete potential theory and electrical circuits. This algorithm is formulated in discrete space (i.e., on a graph) using combinatorial analogues of standard operators and principles from continuous potential theory, allowing it to be applied in arbitrary dimension on arbitrary graphs},

The user marks certain pixels as “object” or “background” to provide hard constraints for segmentation. Additional soft constraints incorporate both boundary and region information. Graph cuts are used to ﬁnd the globally optimal segmentation of the N-dimensional image. The obtained solution gives the best balance of boundary and region properties among all segmentations satisfying the constraints. The topology of our segmentation is unrestricted and both “object” and “background” segments may consist of several isolated parts. Some experimental results are presented in the context of photo/video editing and medical image segmentation. We also demonstrate an interesting Gestalt example. A fast implementation of our segmentation method is possible via a new max-ﬂow algorithm in [2].},

	abstract = {Deep learning techniques have received much attention in the area of image denoising. However, there are substantial differences in the various types of deep learning methods dealing with image denoising. Specifically, discriminative learning based on deep learning can ably address the issue of Gaussian noise. Optimization models based on deep learning are effective in estimating the real noise. However, there has thus far been little related research to summarize the different deep learning techniques for image denoising. In this paper, we offer a comparative study of deep techniques in image denoising. We first classify the deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for additive white noisy images; the deep CNNs for real noisy images; the deep CNNs for blind denoising and the deep CNNs for hybrid noisy images, which represents the combination of noisy, blurred and low-resolution images. Then, we analyze the motivations and principles of the different types of deep learning methods. Next, we compare the state-of-the-art methods on public denoising datasets in terms of quantitative and qualitative analyses. Finally, we point out some potential challenges and directions of future research.},

	abstract = {With the explosion in the number of digital images taken every day, the demand for more accurate and visually pleasing images is increasing. However, the images captured by modern cameras are inevitably degraded by noise, which leads to deteriorated visual image quality. Therefore, work is required to reduce noise without losing image features (edges, corners, and other sharp structures). So far, researchers have already proposed various methods for decreasing noise. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we summarize some important research in the field of image denoising. First, we give the formulation of the image denoising problem, and then we present several image denoising techniques. In addition, we discuss the characteristics of these techniques. Finally, we provide several promising directions for future research.},

We elaborate on the main algorithms and key techniques in each stage, compare, and summarize the advantages and defects of different segmentation models, and discuss their applicability.

	abstract = {Automatic medical image segmentation is a crucial topic in the medical domain and successively a critical counterpart in the computer-aided diagnosis paradigm. U-Net is the most widespread image segmentation architecture due to its flexibility, optimized modular design, and success in all medical image modalities. Over the years, the U-Net model has received tremendous attention from academic and industrial researchers who have extended it to address the scale and complexity created by medical tasks. These extensions are commonly related to enhancing the U-Net's backbone, bottleneck, or skip connections, or including representation learning, or combining it with a Transformer architecture, or even addressing probabilistic prediction of the segmentation map. Having a compendium of different previously proposed U-Net variants makes it easier for machine learning researchers to identify relevant research questions and understand the challenges of the biological tasks that challenge the model. In this work, we discuss the practical aspects of the U-Net model and organize each variant model into a taxonomy. Moreover, to measure the performance of these strategies in a clinical application, we propose fair evaluations of some unique and famous designs on well-known datasets. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive implementation library with trained models. In addition, for ease of future studies, we created an online list of U-Net papers with their possible official implementation.},
